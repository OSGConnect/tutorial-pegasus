exactly but more or lesse, the brest bones are not so proper to be put
in, but put the meat together with the other bones (upon which there
must also be some meat remaining) into a good quantity of that Water or
Broth wherein the Chickens were boyled, and set it then over a
Chaffing-Dish of coales betweeen two Dishes, that so it may stew on till
it be fully enough; but first season it with Salt and gross Pepper, and
afterwards add Oyl to it, more or lesse according to the goodnesse
thereof; and a little before you take it from the fire, you must adde
such a quantity of juyce of Lemons as may best agree with your Taste.
This makes an excellent dish of Meat, which must be served up in the
Liquor; and though for a need it may be made with Butter instead of Oyl,
and with Vinegar in stead of Juyce of Lemons, yet is the other
incomparably better for such as are not Enemies to Oyle. The same Dish
may be made also of Veal, or Partridge, or Rabbets, and indeed the best

_A Spanish Olio._

Take a peice of Bacon not very fat, but sweet and safe from being rusty,
a peice of fresh beefe, a couple of hoggs Eares, and foure feet if they
can be had, and if not, some quantity of sheeps feet, (Calves feet are
not proper) a joynt of Mutton, the Leg, Rack, or Loyne, a Hen, halfe a
dozen pigeons, a bundle of Parsley, Leeks, and Mint, a clove of Garlick
when you will, a small quantity of Pepper, Cloves, and Saffron, so
mingled that not one of them over-rule, the Pepper and Cloves must be
beaten as fine as possible may be, and the Saffron must be first dryed,
and then crumble in powder and dissolved apart in two or three spoonfuls
of broth, but both the Spices and the Saffron may be kept apart till
immediately before they be used, which must not be, till within a
quarter of a houre before the Olio be taken off from the fire; a pottle
of hard dry pease, when they have first steept in water some dayes, a
pint of boyl'd Chesnuts: particular care must be had that the pot
wherein the Olio is made, be very sweet; Earthen I thinke is the best,
and judgement is to be had carefully both in the size of the Pot, and in
the quantity of the Water at the first, that so the Broth may grow
afterwards to be neither too much nor too little, nor too grosse, nor
too thin; thy meat must be long in boyling, but the fire not too fierce,
the Bacon, the Beef, the Pease, the Chesnuts, the Hogs Eares may be put
in at the first. I am utterly against those confused Olios into which
men put almost all kinds of meats and Roots, and especially against
putting of Oyle, for it corrupts the Broath, instead of adding goodnesse
to it. To do well, the Broth is rather to be drunk out of a Porringer
then to be eaten with a spoon, though you add some smal slices of bread
to it, you wil like it the worse. The Sauce for thy meat must be as much
fine Sugar beaten smal to powder, with a little Mustard, as can be made
to drink the Sugar up, and you wil find it to be excellent, but if you
make it not faithfully and justly according to this prescript, but shall
neither put Mace, or Rosemary, or Tyme to the Herbs as the manner is of
some, it will prove very much the worse.


_To make Metheglin._

Take all sorts of Herbs that are good and wholesome, as Balme, Mint,
Fennell, Rosemary, Angelica, wilde Tyme, Isop, Burnet, Egrimony, and
such other as you think fit; some Field Herbs, but you must not put in
too many, but especially Rosemary or any strong Hearb, lesse then halfe
a handfull will serve of every sort, you must boyle your Herbs and
straine them, and let the Liquor stand till to Morrow and settle them,
take off the clearest Liquor, two Gallons and a halfe to one Gallon of
Honey, and that proportion as much as you will make, and let it boyle an
houre, then set it a cooling as you doe Beere, when it is cold take some
very good Ale Barme, and put into the bottome of the Tubb a little and a
little as they doe Beere, keeping backe the thicke setling, that lyeth
in the bottome of the Vessell that it is cooled in, and when it is all
put together, cover it with a Cloth, and let it worke very neere three
dayes, and when you mean to put it up, skim off all the Barme clean, put
it up into the Vessell, but you must not stop your Vessell very close in
three or four dayes, but let it have all the vent, for it will worke,
and when it is close stopped, you must looke very often to it, and have
a peg in the top to give it vent; when you heare it make a noyse, as it
will do, or else it will breake the Vessell; sometime I make a Bag and
put in good store of Ginger sliced, some Cloves and Cinnamon, and boyl
it in, and other times I put it into the Barrel and never boyle it, it
is both good, but Nutmeg and Mace do not well to my Tast.


_To make a Sallet of Smelts._

Take halfe a hundred of Smelts, the biggest you can get, draw them and
cut off their Heads, put them into a Pipkin with a Pint of White wine,
and a Pint of White wine Vinegar, an Onion shred a couple of Lemons, a
Race of Ginger, three or foure blades of Mace, a Nutmeg sliced, whole
Pepper, a little Salt, cover them, and let them stand twenty foure
houres; if you will keep them three or four dayes, let not your Pickle
be to strong of the Vinegar, when you will serve them, take them out one
by one, scrape and open them as you do Anchoves, but throw away the
bones, lay them close one by one, round a Silver dish, you must have the
very utmost rind of a Lemon or Orange so small as grated bread and the
Parsley, then mix your Lemon Pill, Orange and Parsley together with a
little fine beaten Pepper, and strew this upon the dish of Smelts with
the meat of a Lemon minced very small, also then power on excellent
Sallet Oile, and wring in the juyce of two Lemons, but be sure none of
the Lemon-seed be left in the Sallet, so serve it.

_To Roast a Fillet of Veal._

Take a Fillet of Beefe which is the tenderest part of the Beast, and
lieth only in the inward part of the Surloyne next to the Chine, cut it

carefull you broach it not thorow the best of the meat, roast it
leasurely and baste it with sweet butter. Set a Dish under it to save
the Gravy while the Beefe is roasting, prepare the Sauce for it, chop
good store of Parsley with a few sweet Herbs shred small, and the yolks
of three or foure Eggs, and mince among them the pill of an Orange, and
a little Onyon, then boyle this mixture, putting into it sweet butter,
Vinegar, and Gravy, a spoonfull of strong broth, when it is well boyled,
put it into your beef, and serve it very warm, sometimes a little grosse
Pepper or Ginger into your sauce, or a pill of an Orange or Lemon.

carrigon, and mince them together, but not too small, strew them on the
Sallet, Garnish it with Lemons, Oranges or barberies, so serve it up
with a little salt.


_To stew Mushrums._

Take them fresh gathered and cut off the hard end of the stalk, & as you
Pil them throw them into a Dish of white Wine, after they have lain half
an houre or thereupon draine them from the wine, and put them between
two silver Dishes, then set them on a soft fire without any liquor, and
when they have so stewed a while, pour away the liquor that comes from
them which will be very black, then put your Mushrums into another clean
Dish with a sprig or two of Tyme, an Onion whole, four or five cornes of
whole Pepper, two or three Cloves, a bit of an Orange, a little Salt, a
bit of sweet butter, and some pure gravy of Mutton, cover them, and set
them on a gentle fire, so let them stew softly till they be enough and
very tender, when you dish them blow off all the fat from them, and take
out the Time, spice, and Orange, then wring in the juyce of a Lemon, and
grate a little Nutmeg among the Mushrums, tosse them two or three times;
put them in a clean dish, and serve them hot to the Table.

Bason, provided in any case you stir not the Bag, then take Jelly in the
Bason and put it into your bag again, let it run the second time, and it

Glasles which you please, and set them a cooling on bay salt, and when

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
